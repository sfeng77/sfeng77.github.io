## Released Package 
http://www.institute.loni.org/lasigma/package/cthyb/

## Purpose
A Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo Impurity Solver, using the hybridization expansion algorithm.

## Systems
This code has been tested on a computing system equipped with Intel Core i7-2600 CPU, Intel Xeon Phi 7120P co-processor, and Intel icc (ICC) 14.0.2 20140120 compiler.

## Contents
This package contains code and sample data for a Hybridization Expansion Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo Solver. The data generated from the code is tested against published results in literature. For the latest version and other resources visit http://lasigma.loni.org/package/cthyb/.

## Acknowledgments
The accelerator ports of this code were developed by Sheng Feng, Sam Irving, Roozbeh Karimi, Ka-Ming Tam, Jian Tao, Juana Moreno, J. Ramanujam, Mark Jarrell.
